# Interactive component



## Explaination 

The interactive component allows the user to study the positions of a team on a specific map. Positions are split in *CT* and *T* positions as both sides face each other. To generate each map .csv data, we grouped the *damages* data by match id in the  [Generate_csv.Rmd](https://github.com/anhvung/csgo_pro_matches_analysis/blob/main/code/Generate%20csv.Rmd) file. The .csv files are stored in the docs/D3/csv folders of the GitHub repository and are arranged by events, teams and maps.

Hovering over points shows attacker, victim and weapon information.
